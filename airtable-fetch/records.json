    "Intro": "Hi all! I'm Michael, an energy nerd and CEO/co-founder of Evolve Energy.  I've been in the renewables industry for the past 10 years and have seen this really interesting progression in wholesale energy markets where times of the day when renewables are abundant are also the lowest cost times of the day.  So at Evolve, we sell electricity at this wholesale power rate in deregulated markets to residential customers so they can save money AND truly decarbonize their footprint because they are implicitly shifting their usage to times when renewables are abundant and shedding load when it's coal and gas on the margin.  We do some fun stuff with IOT and ML to automate usage timing, which also translates to an interesting product for regulated markets/utilities.  This recent VentureBeat article describes it a bit more and happy to chat with anyone looking to understand this industry!

    "Intro": "I'm glad to be part of this group. Thanks for including me, @Jason. I'm a big believer in multi-disciplinary communities that lead to productive collisions, especially for the climate crisis.  \nMy journey began in 2005. After a few years on wall st, I co-founded a startup focused on food waste-to-biogas and compost using a digestion technology from Germany. KPCB ended up investing in the German company and incubated a startup called Harvest that acquired us. I stayed on with them for a year.\nFor the last decade, I've worked across several climate tech initiatives, mostly within carbon removal/conversion and a portfolio of digital-oriented startups. There were also a handful of storytelling and product development projects along the way. \nOn the carbon front, my colleagues and I helped raise ~$40M mostly from fossil fuel companies for the Carbon XPRIZE, a competition focused on sparking the carbon removal and conversion sector. We started an industry community called the Circular Carbon Network (link in the replies), designed to accelerate capital flow by leveraging network effects and knowledge share. We published an index last fall of technology developers and are now in the midst of developing an index of relevant capital providers. We were part of a lonely and niche group of believers and evangelists for much of the 2010s, but that's dramatically changed for the better in recent years. \nI've also got a small startup portfolio, either through advisory board participation or a few small checks. I spend about half my time working closely with HEVO, a wireless EV charging startup I'm excited about. Wires create a lot of problems for a variety of stakeholders and wireless charging addresses those challenges.  \nI live in Brooklyn with my wife, 3-year-old son, and 3-month-old daughter. I only started listening to the pod in the last few weeks, but I enjoyed the conversation with Albert Wenger. He's got interesting viewpoints and I appreciated Jason diplomatically asking challenging questions. If anyone is interested in EVs, carbon, or just a general chat, hit me up. I'm also in the Bay Area 1-3x per year. Thanks to all for devoting your time and energy to this challenge and opportunity. I look forward to making a positive contribution to this community.",

Early in my career I built spectrum auction models, and I continued to cover the industry\u2019s evolution as mobile overtook landline, and as smartphones surpassed personal computers. Along the way, I covered e-commerce, streaming media, interactive entertainment, social networks, semiconductors and cloud software.\nApplying that structural lens to the broader economy, I see an accelerating shift toward sustainability. As monumental as technology-driven change has been, I believe the transition to a low carbon economy will be significantly more disruptive. ( disrupt or we die )\nI believe my experience identifying technology driven secular shifts is directly applicable to understanding the circular economy transition.\nBeyond core renewable technology, I believe innovations from ai to iot hold great promise to improve efficiency in agriculture, buildings, manufacturing and logistics.\nDespite the tremendous uptake of funds embracing ESG, signing commitments like the PRI and Climate Action 100, most of those portfolios are uninspiring and the earth is still warming. ( striking parallels to funds that largely ignored AAPL AMZN ATVI CRM NFLX until the disruption they wrought was better understood)\nIve been to several sustainable investing conferences, taken courses, read a ton, listened to (almost) every MCJ episode and completed the first level of SASB - Sustainable Accounting Standards Board certification.\nThanks for reading this far, looking forward to what\u2019s next",

We tend to find that there is an 'alphabet soup' for rounds in this market, but usually it means there is early hints of commercial traction being rolled out.\nExamples of our investments range from data platforms monitoring climate adaptation (Jupiter Intelligence) -> renewable energy design (Aurora Solar) -> electrification of transport (Volta Charging).\n",

In climate, we're currently working up brand new company concepts to unify carbon markets, to convert flue gas in to high value chemicals, to breed alternative pollinators and a bunch of other fun projects. We're currently working up a thesis that involves ideas like \"energy efficiency is actually a bad thing on average\" and \"fuel should not be the end goal of CCU, but rather preserving carbon-carbon complexity\" and \"never wait for policy, sovereign nations have greater intrinsic interest in the maintenance of the status quo than anyone else\". I wholeheartedly welcome the debate! Also interested in bringing together a coalition to create a green chemistry supermajor to wipe out incumbent industrial petrochem by providing massive scale to really promising technologies whose commercial viability is a function of their integration into a global chemicals supply chain. Could not be more excited to see the sort of conversations going on here. (edited)",

    "Intro": "I've spent my career trying to use my skills for positive social impact - over the years that's led me to work with nonprofits and startups on all kinds of topics from human services program design, microfinance, financial rehabilitation, and medical decision making. Mostly my job titles have been related to behavioral econ, data science, software engineering, or product management, but at heart I'm a generalist who cares more about problems than about specific techniques for solving them. For a few years I co-led the SF chapter of Datakind, which is a global community of volunteers working with non-profits to apply data/ML to their work. I also was/am a member of The Data Guild with @Beau Cronin.\nAbout a year ago I came to the conclusion that climate change was the biggest and most important problem I could work on, and started out by reading Drawdown to get a sense of the landscape. (I see there are some Drawdown people here, what an amazing resource!) I got to page 1, refrigerant management, and said \"huh, I don't know anything about this. I wonder what I can do to help.\" As I kept learning about it, I started to realize just how important and neglected it is. I spent about 8 months learning about it and talking to knowledgeable people, confirming that there was a major  gap, and that it wasn't a completely impossible problem.\nIn November I quit my job, packed up my San Francisco apartment and moved to Cambodia, where I'm trying to get something off the ground. Ultimately I think that the solution to refrigerant management (especially end-of-life recovery, but also leakage) will involve positive financial incentives relying on digital technology to verify additionality. I don't think anyone knows what that verification will entail, but my hypothesis is that\na) it's possible\nb) the best way to figure it out is to build it as an internal system for a company that's actually operating on the ground.\nSo that's the plan! This is my first time starting something completely from scratch, though I've been an early employee a few times. So I could definitely use advice from people who have done this before, especially when it comes to developing and communicating a vision, and thinking about fundraising,\nI'm still reading through the intros to see who's working on something related, but I'd love to chat with any of you. This is such an inspiring community and I'm glad to be a part of it.",

I\u2019m a PhD student in Interdisciplinary Ecology (whatever that means) at the University of Florida, and I study how climate change will disrupt how species are distributed. As in, what new and potentially invasive insects will be found in soy fields of the American midwest 20-50 years from now, or how will an endangered a mountaintop bird survive if the cold environment it needs disappears? A lot of simulation and agent-based modeling, as well as some fun times romping around tropical rainforests (including flying drones to monitor forest cover, @Devin Gannon). I also build web data access interfaces for environmental research products (e.g. https://ccrcn.shinyapps.io/CoastalCarbonAtlas/) and develop sensors that can track how temperate and humidity changes at high resolution. Also have dabbled in some environmental journalism (https://news.mongabay.com/by/david-klinges/) and filmmaking (https://natureinparadise.github.io/multimedia/intern_video/).\nGlad to be on board and join the conversation!

I co-founded a couple startups out of grad school; we sold the second one, which did machine learning as a service before the big cloud platforms came in and dominated that space, to Salesforce in 2012. I was at Salesforce for three years, which was...interesting.\nIn early 2017, I became a partner at The Data Guild, a mission-driven product studio that works in domains around human and environmental health. My climate journey really began with my first Guild project: a partnership with a large Australian power company where we designed and built a pilot peer-to-peer energy trading platform that empowered residential customers with solar and/or storage to trade excess production.\nMy sense from the past few years of thinking and prototyping is that - notwithstanding the huge amount of data we currently collect about the natural and built worlds - one of the key obstacles to broader, deeper, faster collective action is our lack of direct perception of the threats. I\u2019ve been hacking on data services that provide multivariate, granular information about the world - including economic activities, natural resources, the built environment, and so on. My goal for 2020 is to take these efforts pro, and I\u2019d be interested in conversations with folks here on that front.\nThese days, my technical skills are sharpest in data engineering, cloud architecture (#aws4lyfe), and general backend hacking. I am a systems thinker, and I have the sometimes-annoying habit of expanding problems to include dimensions that are supposed to be out of scope. But once I have an approach sorted, I love to put my head down and build.\nWhat I can offer:\nconversation and advice\ncontracting if there\u2019s a good fit\nconnections to the larger Guild network of mission-driven data and design folks\nWhat I\u2019m looking for:\nhelp in matching up the data / knowledge services I\u2019m developing with specific and impactful uses\nadvice on how to fund this work, which is intended to be self-sustaining (for-profit) but not necessarily venture shape (I want to maximize horizontal usage, rather than value capture in one or more verticals)\nI\u2019ve already spoken to some of you in channels and DMs, and I\u2019m looking forward to getting to know more of you.",

As for my background, I've studied business and computer science and have co-founded 2 tech-startups.  Right now I'm part of an international team of volunteers working on Climate Connect, a global climate action platform (http://climateconnect.earth). I hope, that we'll be able to accelerate climate action globally with Climate Connect.\n\nWe want to allow climate protectors to list their climate action projects on Climate Connect. When listing their project on the platform, the creators will be asked for a few numbers on their project, depending on the project category. From this input, an algorithm will automatically estimate the climate impact of the project.\nThis way, we want to provide an overview of everything, that is done against climate change worldwide and estimate which projects/actions are most effective. This way we want to enable people to find out what is the most impactful thing they can work on and which high impact projects from other locations they could replicate at their location.\nHere is an interactive prototype: https://xd.adobe.com/view/395518bf-7e51-4eb2-6ff2-3f1b57fdaa17-4f64/ (edited)",

Separations are sexy - and account for 12% of all US energy consumption because we do it so inefficiently.  Driving change in large companies has become my life goal, and I love talking about the manufacturing process of just about anything.

Please reach out if anything in my background is interesting and you'd like to learn more.\nMy name is Apoorv Bhargava, and I\u2019m the co-founder and CEO of Weave Grid. Weave Grid is working on intelligently connecting electric vehicles to the grid (jargon alert: EV\u2013 grid integration) in order to use them as a mobile grid resource, that can save utilities and customers billions of dollars, better integrate renewable energy, and of course enable transportation electrification to take off without the grid becoming an impediment.

I also spent some time at NRG, working on behind-the-meter energy storage. I spent the early parts of my career working on energy efficiency and demand response at Opower, and before that was a management consultant at BCG, working with utilities and oil & gas companies.\nI\u2019ve been passionate about climate change and the impact of resource scarcity since I was 13 growing up on a tiny Mediterranean, and my whole academic and career background has been focused on climate solutions. I\u2019m a huge fan of systems thinking and systems solutions, which means I look for approaches that have technology, policy, and biz model strengths. I\u2019m a chemical engineer (spent some time on CCS) and energy economist by training, and was fortunate enough to be named to the Greenbiz and Forbes 30 Under 30 Energy lists in 2019.

I found out that wildfire seasons were getting increasingly hot and dry and that California had already seen the 3 degree jump in temperatures!\nI called Google's carbon team to see if I could throw down some money to buy carbon credits with them and they said no. I tried buying some landfill gas credits through Element Markets in Houston but they tried selling me credits that I later found out were for projects that shut down 10 years ago. I looked into the owner and found out that he was one of the masterminds of the fraud at Enron. I looked into Terrapass and learned that the owner lives in a 40k square foot house. I decided that we needed a high trust carbon offset subscription as a service aka Netflix for Saving the Planet.\nI pitched 100 of my friends and family members and got 30+ signups. Then Project Wren launched on TechCrunch this past summer and it was exactly what I wanted to build. I shut down my project and invested in their company instead. That's how I met Jason.\nThe 2nd biggest problem other than finding good projects was figuring out how to help people live lower carbon lifestyles. As it turns out, quarantine living is the lowest carbon lifestyle you can possibly have. No driving, no flying, just remote work and hanging out with your family in the backyard. I'm now working with a few designers and hardware specialists on building out the infrastructure needed to take existing homes off the grid, totally eliminating a major portion of your carbon footprint in the process.\nI think our best chance to alter consumer behavior is to capitalize on the pandemic quarantines of the next 12-24 months and see how much will stick.\nI have started a slack channel today for people who are interested in joining a pandemic action response team. Part of this team will be focused on coordinating the manufacture of these low carbon systems. DM for an invite or if you'd like to chat!",

Feel free to ask me any science questions and if I don\u2019t know, I probably know someone that does.\nI also spent 6 months undertaking my own climate journey with Deep Science Ventures (venture fund who starts impactful science companies) \u2013 speaking to academics and looking at where you could start climate positive companies that can be backed by standard VC !\n.\nFounder :tophat:\nThis led me to come up with the idea for Thermulon \u2013 sustainably produced, affordable and fire-safe building insulation materials (in the wake of Grenfell tower block fire disaster in the UK).\nBuilding insulation isn\u2019t super sexy, but humanity spends vast sums of (O&G) energy on heating our homes and offices (~35% of energy in the EU) \u2013 so high performance materials are an important bullet in the climate fight. We\u2019re a process chemistry company at heart (which is tough finding investors who love CapEx), currently developing our tech and fundraising.\n.\nActivist :helmet_with_white_cross:\nI have been on a number of Extinction Rebellion marches / events in London (yet to be arrested), but believe it\u2019s been a massive driver in changing the attitudes towards climate in the UK. An issue which even a year or so ago wasn\u2019t particularly prevalent in the eyes of the public \u2013 is now being talked by most people in some capacity. I think what they\u2019re doing is pretty powerful (although methods vary).\nPlease talk to me about any / all of the above!

During my time in the corporate world, I also launched a virtual summit about Vertical Farming and Urban Agriculture, and volunteered for innovative nonprofits focused on food and waste reduction, including The Association for Vertical Farming, Thought for Food, and Plant Chicago.\nI\u2019ve been obsessively studying and networking in the areas of sustainable food production, circular economies, AgTech, and Climate since about 2014 and have had the opportunity to meet a lot of cool people.\nIn 2020 I have two big picture goals:\nReduce my personal impact by setting up a permaculture landscape / garden, make my house in Michigan net zero, and to change my buying habits.\nTo earn a full-time living by helping to grow climate-effective companies / organizations.\nProfessional Skills: I have a chemical engineering degree with a research concentration in functional nanomaterials, My business experience is in optimizing manufacturing processes, high value & complex technical sales, running training seminars, writing compelling sales copy, launching online products, marketing / positioning, strategy, environmental consulting, and some experience hiring, training and building teams.\nDuring the first year of my career, I did a leadership rotation program, so I\u2019ve worn many different hats, including lab ops, sales, marketing, manufacturing, engineering, product development, product management, and quality control.\nWhere I Hope to Add Value to This Group:\nTechnical expertise and engineering skills, particularly when it comes to evaluating manufacturing and energy systems.\nBrokering high value partnerships / sales transactions\nProviding connections to my network.\nOn a personal side, I enjoy reading, writing, martial arts, backpacking, traveling, learning new things, playing games and time w/ friends and family.\nIf you want to learn more about me, I have a personal site www.chrispowers.me (work in progress) & feel free to reply to this post or message me privately to discuss any of the above information further.",

My climate journey started circa 2005, following a National Academy of Science talk revealing how \"f**ked\" our climate was! My deep dive involved a long, entirely tortured learning curve (though I did \"crowd-source\" some of my climate education by developing community environmental programs), which is why I am particularly thrilled that @Jason's efforts will shorten that process for others. By 2010, I settled on trying to assess carbon pricing impacts on portfolios. We explored all low-carbon energy generation and we designed a strategy to reject fossil fuel's carbon exposure but actually replace that with proportional exposure to low-carbon generation\u2014which was, and still is, nuclear power. These days, I am taking what I learned over the last decade to the next level and I am now working to launch Nucleation Capital, a pooled investment vehicle to invest in advanced energy systems, 4th gen nuclear, deep decarbonization, climate services and other requisite facets of the future carbon-priced economy.",

I originally joined DSV to scope Negative Emissions Technologies, but it quickly became apparent that the primary bottlenecks to accelerated NET deployment are at the market end.\nMy remit is (a) to create ventures in the Negative Emissions Markets Space (hoping for 3 by the end of April) and (b) to beat @Dom at board games.\nHow did I get here?\nI studied Mechanical Engineering with an emphasis on polymer processing and human-centred design.\nUpon graduating, I joined LabGenius (a Synthetic Biology + AI startup) as part of the founding team. I stayed with LabGenius for four glorious years from 3 people to 30, but ultimately left to work more directly on climate-related problems. It was a progressively growing itch I couldn\u2019t ignore anymore.\nIf anyone is interested in the Negative Emissions Space - I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts! Also, if it looks like I could be helpful in any way, please get in touch :)",
